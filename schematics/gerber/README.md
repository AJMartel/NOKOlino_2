# About the versions
  
## V1.0  
This is the original releae, used in this wiki. Works fine.

## V1.1  
This release enhances the former V1.0 with some additions:  
* The four buttons were turned 90 degrees and the JQ6500 was moved slightly to the right. Now it is easier to plug in a micro USB cable.  
* A place for a 220k resistor and connectors for a SFH300 photo transistor were added.
* The holes for the strain relief were reinforced.
